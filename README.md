# Presurgical Form 

This is an extraction of one of the main sections of an app for learning purposes that currently doesn´t have a better name, so I just called it Hospital App,  you can find the main repository here [https://github.com/Juan-45/hospital_app](https://github.com/Juan-45/hospital_app).

It was used: React functional components and hooks, Material UI, use-debounce, React-pdf and RegEx.

It can create a pre surgical sheet for a patient before he/she goes to surgery.
